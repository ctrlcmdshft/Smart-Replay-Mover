## ✨ Why Smart Replay Mover?

  Smart Replay Mover is a single **Lua script** that you add to OBS. It requires no Python, no libraries, and no external dependencies.

  Instead of only checking what OBS is recording, it uses OS-level APIs (Win32 FFI on Windows, `xprop` on Linux) to detect the active window focus. This allows it to correctly sort files even if you're using Display Capture, Borderless Windowed modes, or playing games with strict anti-cheat.

  <div align="center">

  | ❌ Before | ✅ After |
  |-----------|----------|
  | All clips in one messy folder | Organized by game automatically |
  | Manual sorting after each session | Set and forget |
  | No idea when clip was saved | Visual + sound notifications |
  | Python scripts with broken dependencies | Single Lua file, zero setup |

  </div>

## 📥 Installation

### Windows

  1. **Download** the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/SlonickLab/Smart-Replay-Mover/releases)

  2. **Extract** the ZIP archive
     > ⚠️ Do NOT load the .zip file directly into OBS

  3. **Move** `Smart_Replay_Mover.lua` to a permanent location (e.g., Documents)

  4. **Add to OBS:**
     - Open OBS Studio
     - Go to `Tools` → `Scripts`
     - Click `+` and select the `.lua` file

  5. **Done!** The script works immediately with default settings. No Python, no dependencies.

### 🐧 Linux

  1. **Download** and extract the same way
  2. **Add to OBS** the same way (`Tools` → `Scripts` → `+`)
  3. **Install dependencies** — run the included setup script:

  ```bash
  cd "For Linux"
  chmod +x install_linux_deps.sh
  ./install_linux_deps.sh
  ```

  The script auto-detects your package manager (apt, pacman, dnf, zypper, apk) and installs everything needed:

- `xprop` — game detection (X11)
- `notify-send` — desktop notifications
- `paplay` / `pw-play` — notification sound
- `ffmpeg` / `ffprobe` — video thumbnails (both come from the same package)
- Also checks for `curl` or `wget` (update check)

  1. **Done!** The script auto-detects Linux — no configuration needed.

  > 💡 On **Wayland**, detection works for games that run through XWayland, which includes everything under Proton. Windows running natively on Wayland can't be read, so those clips go to the fallback folder.

  <summary>Manual installation (if you prefer)</summary>

  | Package | Purpose | Install (Arch) | Install (Debian/Ubuntu) |
  |---------|---------|----------------|------------------------|
  | `xprop` | Game detection (X11) | `sudo pacman -S xorg-xprop` | `sudo apt install x11-utils` |
  | `notify-send` | Desktop notifications | `sudo pacman -S libnotify` | `sudo apt install libnotify-bin` |
  | `paplay` / `pw-play` | Notification sound | Usually pre-installed | Usually pre-installed |
  | `ffmpeg` / `ffprobe` | Video thumbnails | `sudo pacman -S ffmpeg` | `sudo apt install ffmpeg` |

  </details>

## 🔍 How It Works

  The script uses a multi-step detection chain to identify what you're playing. Each step is a fallback for the previous one:

  ```
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  Priority 1: Custom Names (your rules — ALWAYS highest)        │
  │  Priority 2: Active process name (Win32 / xprop)               │
  │  Priority 3: Built-in game database (1900+ games)              │
  │  Priority 4: Pattern matching (auto-clean process names)       │
  │  Priority 5: Window title fallback (anti-cheat bypass)         │
  │  Priority 6: OBS capture source names                          │
  │  Priority 7: Background game scan (optional, Windows only)     │
  │  Priority 8: Fallback folder (default: "Desktop")              │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
  ```

  Every platform-specific code path is wrapped in `pcall()` — the script **never crashes** regardless of OS or settings.

## ⚙️ Configuration

  Click on the script in OBS Scripts window to access settings:

### 📁 File Naming

  | Setting | Description |
  |---------|-------------|
  | Add game prefix | Adds game name to filename (e.g., `CS2 - Replay 2025-06-15.mp4`) |
  | Fallback folder | Folder name when no game detected (default: `Desktop`) |

### 🎮 Custom Names (Highest Priority)

  | Setting | Description |
  |---------|-------------|
  | Game field | Process name, `+keywords`, or `*pattern*` to match |
  | Folder field | Target folder name (or `.` / `/` for no subfolder) |
  | Add button | Saves the new mapping |
  | Your mappings | Edit or delete existing rules |

### 💾 Backup

  | Setting | Description |
  |---------|-------------|
  | File path | Optional custom path for import/export |
  | Import | Load custom names from file |
  | Export | Save custom names to file |

### 🔄 Buffer Control

  | Setting | Description |
  |---------|-------------|
  | Auto-restart after save | Stops and restarts buffer after each save (prevents overlap) |
  | Auto-start on launch | Automatically starts Replay Buffer when OBS opens |
  | Smart Save Hotkey | Assign in OBS Settings → Hotkeys → "Smart Save Replay" for instant feedback |

### 🎬 Replay Buffer Pro

  | Setting | Description |
  |---------|-------------|
  | Mode | Auto-Detect (default — activates only when the plugin is installed), Always On, or Off |
  | Remove "_trimmed" suffix | Renames Replay Buffer Pro's trimmed clip back to a clean name while organizing (on by default) |

### 🧩 Folder Templates

  The destination folder is a **template** of `{tokens}`, resolved when each clip is saved. The default `{game}` reproduces the classic per-game layout.

  | Token | Expands to |
  |-------|------------|
  | `{game}` | Detected game folder (e.g. `Counter-Strike 2`) |
  | `{type}` | `Replays`, `Recordings` or `Screenshots` |
  | `{year}` `{month}` `{day}` | `2026` / `07` / `23` |
  | `{date}` | `2026-07-23` |
  | `{yearmonth}` | `2026-07` (the old monthly-subfolder format) |
  | `{hour}` `{min}` | Clock time |

  **Examples**

  | Template | Result |
  |----------|--------|
  | `{game}` | `Counter-Strike 2/` |
  | `{game}/{type}` | `Counter-Strike 2/Replays/`, `Counter-Strike 2/Screenshots/` |
  | `{type}/{game}` | `Replays/Counter-Strike 2/` |
  | `{game}/{yearmonth}` | `Counter-Strike 2/2026-07/` |
  | `{yearmonth}/{game}` | `2026-07/Counter-Strike 2/` |
  | `{game}/{year} - {hour} - {min}` | `Counter-Strike 2/2026 - 18 - 53/` |

  Combine tokens in one folder with any separator you like. Only `/` starts a new subfolder, so `{hour} - {min}` becomes `18 - 53` and `{game}/{year} - {hour} - {min}` becomes `Counter-Strike 2/2026 - 18 - 53/`.

  The template is always resolved **relative to the OBS output folder** — every segment is sanitized, so an absolute path, a drive letter, or `..` can never send a clip outside it. Unknown tokens are left as-is, so a typo is visible instead of silently dropped.

  > 💡 `{type}` is what keeps replays, recordings and screenshots apart inside one game folder. With `{game}/{type}` a saved replay lands in `Counter-Strike 2/Replays`, a recording in `Counter-Strike 2/Recordings`, and a screenshot in `Counter-Strike 2/Screenshots`. Leave it out and nothing changes.

  > 💡 Upgrading from the old **Monthly subfolders** checkbox? A one-time **Migrate** button appears here and folds it into your template as `{game}/{yearmonth}` — your existing layout is preserved.

### 🗂️ Organization

  | Setting | Description |
  |---------|-------------|
  | Organize screenshots | Also sort screenshots |
  | Organize recordings | Sort regular recordings (not just replays) |
  | Group split recordings | Put the parts of a split recording in their own session folder, numbered `Part 01`, `Part 02` |
  | Scan all processes | Detect background games when alt-tabbed (Windows only) |

### 🛡️ Spam Protection

  | Setting | Description |
  |---------|-------------|
  | Cooldown | Seconds between saves (prevents duplicates) |
  | Auto-delete | Automatically remove duplicate files |

### 🔔 Notifications

  | Setting | Description |

  | Scale % | Resize popup for 4K/HiDPI monitors, 100–300% (Windows) |
  | Position | Choose popup corner: Top Right, Top Left, Bottom Right, Bottom Left (Windows) |
  | Notification sound | Default, Quiet, any `.wav` in the `sounds/` folder, or Random |
  | Single notification | Show only the "Saving..." popup, stay quiet after |
  | Duration | How long popup stays visible (1–10 seconds) |
  | Test button | Preview notifications instantly from settings |

### 🔧 Tools & Debug

  | Setting | Description |
  |---------|-------------|
  | Debug mode | Show detailed detection messages in OBS Script Log |
  | OS Mode | Auto-Detect (default), Windows, or Linux — for testing cross-platform |

### 🎬 FFmpeg Thumbnails (Advanced)

  | Setting | Description |
  |---------|-------------|
  | Enable Thumbnails | Embed an MP4/MKV frame as cover art |
  | FFmpeg Path | Path to `ffmpeg.exe` (Windows) or `ffmpeg` (Linux); MP4 validation also requires the bundled `ffprobe` |

## 🎮 Custom Names

  Three powerful matching modes for any situation:

### Exact Match

  ```
  CS2 > Counter-Strike 2
  ```

  Maps process name directly to folder name. Simplest and fastest.

### Keywords Mode

  ```
  +Warhammer Marine > Space Marine 2
  ```

  Matches if **all** keywords are present (AND logic). Prefix with `+`.

### Contains Mode

  ```
  *Space Marine 2* > Space Marine 2
  ```

  Matches if text is found **anywhere** in process name or window title. Wrap in `*`.

  > 💡 **Pro Tip:** Contains mode is perfect for games with version numbers that change with updates!
  >
  > Example: `*Space Marine 2*` matches `Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine 2 CLIENT v11.2.799056`

### No-Folder Mode

  ```
  chrome > /
  discord > .
  ```

  Map a process to `/`, `\`, or `.` to keep files in the OBS output root without creating a subfolder. The game prefix is still added if enabled.

### Examples

  | Custom Name | What It Matches |
  |-------------|-----------------|
  | `r5apex > Apex Legends` | Process `r5apex.exe` → folder `Apex Legends` |
  | `+Warhammer Space > WH40K` | Any window containing both words |
  | `*Cyberpunk* > Cyberpunk 2077` | `Cyberpunk 2077 v2.1 Patch...` |
  | `*Sea of Thieves* > Sea of Thieves` | Works even with anti-cheat blocking process |
  | `chrome > /` | Chrome clips stay in OBS output root (no subfolder) |

  > ⚠️ **CRITICAL TIP:** When using `*pattern*`, you are matching the **WINDOW TITLE**, not the .exe name!
  >
  > - ❌ `*cs2*` → Won't work because the window is named "Counter-Strike 2" (doesn't contain "cs2").
  > - ✅ `*Counter-Strike*` → Works perfectly!
  > - ❌ `*FactoryGamesteam*` → Won't work because window is named "Satisfactory".
  > - ✅ `*Satisfactory*` → Works perfectly!

  The `*pattern*` mode matches the window title, which works even when anti-cheat blocks process detection!

  ---

## 🔔 Notification System

### Windows

  The script creates a native Win32 overlay window — a dark semi-transparent popup similar to NVIDIA ShadowPlay. It fades in/out smoothly and is completely click-through.

- **Borderless/Windowed** → visual popup + optional sound
- **Exclusive Fullscreen** → sound only (popup can't overlay fullscreen)

### 🐧 Linux

  Notifications use `notify-send` for visual alerts and `paplay`/`pw-play` for sound. Works with any desktop environment.

### 📑 Chapter Markers

  OBS has its own "Add Chapter Marker" hotkey, but it gives no feedback, and it silently does nothing when the recording format doesn't support chapters. The script adds a hotkey that places the marker and tells you what happened.

  1. Open OBS **Settings → Hotkeys** and find **Smart Add Chapter Marker (With Notification)**
  2. Bind your key there
  3. If you had OBS's own **Add Chapter Marker** bound, unbind it — otherwise one press adds two chapters

  Markers are named **Chapter 1**, **Chapter 2** and so on, matching the notification. OBS also adds its own marker at the very start of the file, so your player lists that one first. When a marker can't be added, the notification says why:

  | Message | Why |
  |---------|-----|
  | Recording is not running | Chapters only exist in recordings |
  | Recording is paused | OBS doesn't place chapters while paused |
  | Needs Hybrid MP4 or Hybrid MOV | Chapters need one of these recording formats (Settings → Output → Recording Format) |
  | Needs OBS 30.2 or newer | Chapter markers were added to OBS in version 30.2 |

### 🔊 Custom Notification Sound

  1. Find a short sound file (1–2 seconds recommended)
  2. Convert to **WAV format** if needed
  3. Rename to `notification_sound.wav`
  4. Place in the same folder as the script:

  > 💡 The **Default** and **Quiet** choices always use `notification_sound.wav` and `notification_sound_silent.wav` right here in the script folder, so keep those two where they are. Extra `.wav` files go in a `sounds` subfolder next to the script; they fill the Notification sound dropdown, and **Random** picks from that folder.

  ```
  📁 Your Folder/
  ├── Smart_Replay_Mover.lua
  ├── notification_sound.wav          ← Default sound
  ├── notification_sound_silent.wav   ← Quiet sound
  └── 📁 sounds/                      ← extra sounds (picker + Random)
      ├── coin.wav
      └── chime.wav
  ```

  1. Reload the script — done!

### 🔇 Quiet Sound Option
  
  If the standard sound is too loud, you can use a separate "quiet" sound file:
  
  1. Prepare a quieter sound file
  2. Name it `notification_sound_silent.wav`
  3. Place it in the same folder
  4. In script settings, set **Notification sound** to **Quiet**
  
  Now you can toggle between the Normal and Quiet versions instantly! Works on both Windows and Linux.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### 🛑 Nothing happens when I test?
  
  **IMPORTANT:** The script detects the **Active Window** (what you are currently looking at).
  
- If you Alt-Tab to OBS to change settings → The script sees "OBS Studio".
- Since OBS is in the ignores list, the script does nothing.
  
  **How to Test Properly:**

  1. Set up your Custom Names.
  2. **Alt-Tab back into the game.**
  3. Wait 3–5 seconds.
  4. Save a Replay.
  5. Check the folder.

  ---

### Clips save to "Desktop" instead of game folder?

  Some games with **anti-cheat protection** (Easy Anti-Cheat, Vanguard, etc.) block the script from reading the process name. If the game isn't in our built-in list, it will fall back to "Desktop".

  **Solution:** Add a Custom Name mapping:

  1. Open OBS → Tools → Scripts → Click on the script
  2. In **CUSTOM NAMES** section, enter:
     - Game: `*Your Game Name*` (with asterisks)
     - Folder: `Your Game Name`
  3. Click **Add**

  **Examples:**

  | Game | Folder | Type |
  |------|--------|------|
  | `*Sea of Thieves*` | Sea of Thieves | Matches Window Title |
  | `*New World*` | New World | Matches Window Title |
  | `*PUBG*` | PUBG | Matches Window Title |

  > 💡 **CRITICAL TIP:** When using `*pattern*`, you are matching the **WINDOW TITLE**, not the .exe name!
  >
  > - ❌ `*cs2*` → Won't work because the window is named "Counter-Strike 2" (doesn't contain "cs2").
  > - ✅ `*Counter-Strike*` → Works perfectly!
  > - ❌ `*FactoryGamesteam*` → Won't work because window is named "Satisfactory".
  > - ✅ `*Satisfactory*` → Works perfectly!

  The `*pattern*` mode matches the window title, which works even when anti-cheat blocks process detection!

  ---

### 🖼️ Thumbnails not appearing on MP4 files?

- Thumbnails are embedded into **MP4 and MKV** only. MOV, FLV, TS, AVI and WebM are moved without one, because the cover-art stream does not survive those containers
- MP4 files also need `ffprobe` next to `ffmpeg`. It comes in the same download, so if you extracted the whole FFmpeg folder it is already there
- Enable **Debug Mode** in Tools & Debug — the Script Log names the exact reason a thumbnail was skipped
- Your clip is never at risk here: whenever anything looks wrong the file is moved untouched instead of being remuxed

  ---

### 🐧 Linux: Notifications not showing?

  Make sure `notify-send` is installed:

  ```bash
  which notify-send
  # If missing: sudo apt install libnotify-bin (Ubuntu) or sudo pacman -S libnotify (Arch)
  ```

### 🐧 Linux: Sound not playing?

  Make sure `paplay` or `pw-play` is available, and `notification_sound.wav` is in the same folder as the script.

### 🐧 Linux: FFmpeg thumbnails not working?

- Check that FFmpeg path is correct (`ffmpeg` for PATH or `/usr/bin/ffmpeg` for absolute)
- Check that `ffprobe` is installed too — MP4 files need it, and it comes from the same package
- Enable **Debug Mode** in Tools & Debug and check the OBS Script Log for errors
- Check file permissions for the video files

  ---

## 🎞️ Video Thumbnails (FFmpeg)

  Enhance your clip library by embedding high-quality cover art into your videos. This allows Windows Explorer (and tools like [Icaros](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/icaros.html)) to display a frame from your gameplay as the file icon instead of a generic media player logo.

### Windows Setup

  1. Go to [gyan.dev](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/) (recommended Windows builds).
  2. Download the `ffmpeg-release-essentials.zip` (it includes both `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe`).
  3. Extract it to a permanent folder (e.g., `C:\Program Files\ffmpeg`).
  4. In script settings → **FFmpeg Thumbnails** → Enable and browse to `ffmpeg.exe` (inside the `bin` folder).

### 🐧 Linux Setup

  1. Install via your package manager: `sudo apt install ffmpeg` or `sudo pacman -S ffmpeg`
  2. In script settings → set FFmpeg Path to `ffmpeg` or `/usr/bin/ffmpeg`

### ✨ How It Works

- **MKV files** — thumbnail attached as Matroska attachment (best for Icaros on Windows)
- **MP4 files** — thumbnail embedded as an attached picture stream; audio-track names and the finished output are verified with `ffprobe` before the source is removed
- **Other containers** — moved normally without remuxing; FFmpeg's attached-picture behavior is not portable to true MOV, FLV, TS, AVI, or WebM output
- **Silent & Invisible** — FFmpeg runs completely in the background without popups
- **No Quality Loss** — Metadata is embedded without re-encoding your video
- **Cross-Platform** — Proper shell quoting on both Windows and Linux

## 🔌 Replay Buffer Pro Support

  Smart Replay Mover is fully compatible with [Replay Buffer Pro](https://github.com/JoshuaPotter/replay-buffer-pro) — the plugin that saves your replay buffer at custom lengths (15s / 30s / 5min…) and trims the file in the background without re-encoding.

  **How it works together:** when a replay is saved, the script no longer moves it instantly. Each save goes into a **deferred move queue** — the script watches the original file and the plugin's `_trimmed` file, waits until trimming is finished, and only then organizes the final clip into your game folder (removing the `_trimmed` suffix by default). While Replay Buffer Pro mode is active, spam protection switches to path-based deduplication: rapid saves of different durations are all kept, and **no files are ever auto-deleted**.

  **Setup:** none. Install the plugin, restart OBS, and the script auto-detects it — the Script Log will show `Replay Buffer Pro integration: ACTIVE (mode: auto)`. If your setup doesn't show that line, set **🎬 REPLAY BUFFER PRO → Mode** to **Always On** in the script settings.

  > 💙 Built with the blessing of Replay Buffer Pro's author — see [JoshuaPotter/replay-buffer-pro#23](https://github.com/JoshuaPotter/replay-buffer-pro/issues/23). If the plugin's file naming ever changes, its author will open an issue here so compatibility can be maintained.

## 📋 Changelog

### v2.20.0 — 📑 Chapter Markers & Safer Moves

- **📑 Chapter marker hotkey.** A new **Smart Add Chapter Marker** hotkey places a chapter in your recording and shows a notification. It also tells you when a marker wasn't added and why, which OBS's own hotkey never does: it silently skips recordings in formats without chapter support. Bind it instead of OBS's **Add Chapter Marker**, not alongside it. See [Chapter Markers](#-chapter-markers). ([Issue #38](https://github.com/SlonickLab/Smart-Replay-Mover/issues/38), thanks @Besdroxk)
- **🐧 Update check on Linux.** The update check only ever worked on Windows, so Linux users were never told about new versions and the settings just said "Check unavailable". It now works through `curl` or `wget`, and the download button opens the releases page. ([Issue #37](https://github.com/SlonickLab/Smart-Replay-Mover/issues/37), thanks @TheFloatingCloud40)
- **🛡️ Clips can no longer overwrite each other.** When a clip's path came close to the 260-character path limit, the script shortened the end of the file name, which is where the timestamp lives, so later clips of the same game ended up with the same name. If the collision-safe " (2)" name didn't fit either, it fell back to the taken name and replaced the older clip. It now keeps room for that suffix, and in the rare case that nothing fits, the clip stays in the OBS folder instead.
- **🛡️ Failed moves are reported honestly.** A move that failed, for example on a locked file or a folder on another drive, was still logged as done and showed "Clip Saved", so the clip quietly stayed in the OBS folder. Failures are now logged as errors, and the popup says so too. A replay is retried for up to two minutes in case the file was only briefly locked, then shows "Move Failed". Screenshots and recordings show "Screenshot Not Moved" or "Recording Not Moved" instead of "Saved".
- **🐧 No more freeze on KDE Wayland.** On KDE Plasma without an X display, every save turned the cursor into a crosshair and froze OBS for up to 25 seconds. The call it used was KDE's "click a window to inspect it" picker rather than a way to find the active window, so it has been removed. Those saves now go to the fallback folder without the freeze. Before, they only landed in the right folder if you clicked the game window while the crosshair was showing.
- **🖼️ Thumbnails for games with "%" in the name.** On Windows, FFmpeg thumbnails for games like *100% Orange Juice* left a stray file and a duplicate clip behind. The name now reaches FFmpeg intact.
- **🖼️ No leftovers with non-English folder names.** On Windows, when a clip's path had letters outside English, such as a Cyrillic or accented user name, FFmpeg thumbnails left the original clip and a `.thumb.jpg` behind in the OBS folder, next to the finished copy in the game folder. Those files are now deleted properly.
- **🐧 Screenshots after alt-tab on Linux.** The short screenshot cache counted CPU time instead of real time on Linux, so a screenshot taken right after switching games could land in the previous game's folder.

### v2.16.0 — 🎞️ Grouped Split Recordings

- **🎞️ Group split recordings into a session folder.** When OBS splits a long recording, the parts used to sit next to each other in the game folder, told apart only by their timestamps. A new **Group split recordings** option puts each recording's parts into their own folder named after the session start time, numbered `Part 01`, `Part 02`, and so on. It works with any folder template, and recordings that were never split are left exactly as before. The game name in the filename still follows your existing **Add game prefix** setting. ([Issue #36](https://github.com/SlonickLab/Smart-Replay-Mover/issues/36), thanks @emoeckel)
- **📅 Monthly subfolders migrate themselves.** The old *Monthly subfolders* checkbox is folded into your folder template as `{game}/{yearmonth}` the first time the script loads, instead of waiting for you to find the **Migrate** button. Anyone who upgraded from an older version and never opened the settings was still running on the old flag. The folders it produces are exactly the same as before.

### v2.15.0 — 🗂️ Separate Folders per Media Type

- **🗂️ New `{type}` template token.** Replays, recordings and screenshots can each get their own subfolder inside the game folder. `{game}/{type}` gives `Elden Ring/Replays`, `Elden Ring/Recordings` and `Elden Ring/Screenshots`. The token works anywhere in the template, so `{type}/{game}` and `{game}/{year}/{type}` are equally valid. A template without `{type}` behaves exactly as before. ([Issue #35](https://github.com/SlonickLab/Smart-Replay-Mover/issues/35), thanks @NKrN2)

### v2.14.0 — 🖼️ Safer Thumbnails

- **💾 A failed FFmpeg run could cost you the recording.** The script waited for FFmpeg to finish but never read its exit code, so a crashed or half-finished run still counted as a success whenever the leftover file was larger than 90% of the original — and the original was then deleted. The exit code is now checked, and anything other than a clean finish falls back to a normal move. ([PR #34](https://github.com/SlonickLab/Smart-Replay-Mover/pull/34), thanks @Txaverria)
- **🔊 MP4 audio track names survive thumbnail embedding.** Embedding cover art rewrites the MP4, and the custom track names you set in OBS were not carried over, so VLC showed "Track 1" and "Track 2" instead of your labels. The names are now read before the remux and written back after, and the finished file is compared against the original before the source is removed. ([PR #33](https://github.com/SlonickLab/Smart-Replay-Mover/pull/33), thanks @Txaverria)
- **🎞️ MP4 and MKV only.** Cover art embedding now runs for MP4 and MKV. MOV, FLV, TS, AVI and WebM are moved normally without a remux, because FFmpeg's attached-picture stream does not survive those containers anyway.
- **🔍 MP4 thumbnails need `ffprobe`.** It ships in the same FFmpeg download and the same Linux package. If it is missing, the clip is moved without a thumbnail instead of being remuxed blindly, so your track names stay intact.

### v2.13.0 — 🐧 Proton Fix & Notification Options

- **🐧 Proton folder names.** Games launched through Proton no longer save into a `steam_app_<AppID>` folder. When the running process is a generic Steam AppID, the script now takes the real game name from the window title. ([Issue #32](https://github.com/SlonickLab/Smart-Replay-Mover/issues/32), thanks @WatislavB)
- **🔉 Notification sound picker.** Pick the notification sound from a dropdown. Drop your own `.wav` files into a `sounds` folder next to the script and they appear as choices, or pick **Random** to play a different one on each clip. ([Issue #31](https://github.com/SlonickLab/Smart-Replay-Mover/issues/31); random idea by @Jazun)
- **🔔 Single notification.** A new toggle shows only the "Saving..." popup on a replay save and stays quiet afterward. Screenshots, recordings, and the test button are unaffected. ([Issue #31](https://github.com/SlonickLab/Smart-Replay-Mover/issues/31), thanks @Txaverria)
- **🔧 Notification polish.** A replay now beeps once (on "Saving...") and shows a single "Clip Saved" confirmation, instead of the sound and popup repeating while the clip is organized.

### v2.12.0 — 🌐 UNC Network Path Fix

- **🌐 UNC network share fix.** Clips now save when the OBS output folder is a UNC path such as `\\server\share\...`. Creating a new game folder on a share used to fail: the folder-creation step collapsed the leading `\\` into a single `\`, so Windows stopped seeing it as a network path and the clip was left in place. Existing folders still worked, so only brand-new game folders broke. ([Issue #30](https://github.com/SlonickLab/Smart-Replay-Mover/issues/30), thanks @SmashinVP)

### v2.11.0 — 🧩 Folder Templates & 🏷️ Prefix = Folder Name

- **🧩 Folder Templates** — The destination folder is now a **template** of `{tokens}` (`{game}`, `{year}`, `{month}`, `{day}`, `{date}`, `{yearmonth}`, `{hour}`, `{min}`) instead of a fixed `<game>` layout. The default `{game}` keeps the classic behavior; every path segment is sanitized so a template can never escape the OBS output folder. See [Folder Templates](#-folder-templates).
- **📅 Monthly Subfolders → `{yearmonth}`** — The old *Monthly subfolders* checkbox is replaced by the `{yearmonth}` token. If you had it enabled, a one-time **Migrate** button folds it into your template as `{game}/{yearmonth}` and then disappears — existing layouts are preserved.
- **🏷️ Prefix = Folder Name** — The game-name prefix added to filenames now matches the destination folder (custom mappings and database names included) instead of the raw process name. With a mapping `shadps4.exe > Bloodborne` you now get `Bloodborne - Replay.mp4`, and database games get their pretty name too (`Aliens vs Predator - Replay.mp4` instead of `avp - Replay.mp4`). No-folder mode (`/`) keeps its old behavior.
- **🔍 Custom Mappings in Background Scan** — The **Scan all running processes** option now also matches your custom name mappings and internal alias names. Previously it only consulted the built-in database, so tabbed-out saves could land in the fallback folder even with a correct mapping ([Issue #28](https://github.com/SlonickLab/Smart-Replay-Mover/issues/28))
- **🎮 Database +2** — Added **Arena Breakout: Infinite** (`UAGame.exe`) and **Chivalry 2** (`Chivalry2-Win64-Shipping.exe`); the Arena Breakout launcher joined the ignore list ([Issue #28](https://github.com/SlonickLab/Smart-Replay-Mover/issues/28))
- **📖 Log Clarity** — The `Using cached game:` log line is now `Game folder:` — replay detection runs fresh on every save, and the old wording wrongly suggested a stale cache

### v2.10.0 — 🔌 Replay Buffer Pro Compatibility

- **🔌 Replay Buffer Pro Integration** — Full compatibility with the [Replay Buffer Pro](https://github.com/JoshuaPotter/replay-buffer-pro) plugin, built with its author's blessing ([JoshuaPotter/replay-buffer-pro#23](https://github.com/JoshuaPotter/replay-buffer-pro/issues/23)). Replays now go through a **deferred move queue**: the script waits for the plugin's background trim to finish, then organizes the final clip. New **🎬 REPLAY BUFFER PRO** settings group (Mode: Auto-Detect / Always On / Off).
- **✂️ Clean Names** — The `_trimmed` suffix the plugin leaves on clips is removed during organizing (optional, on by default).
- **🛡️ Smarter Spam Protection** — In Replay Buffer Pro mode duplicates are detected by file path, so rapid saves of different durations (15s/30s/60s hotkeys) are all kept — and files are never auto-deleted.
- **🛡️ Collision-Safe Naming** — New clips get a `name (2).mp4` suffix instead of silently overwriting an existing file with the same name in the target folder.
- **🐛 Crash-Safety** — The recording `file_changed` signal handler is now `pcall`-guarded like every other callback.

### v2.9.5 — 🔔 Notification Toggle Fix

- **🔔 Popup Toggle Fixed** — The visual popup now respects the **Show visual popup** setting. Previously it appeared on every save even when disabled (the setting was read but never checked on the display path); the sound notification was unaffected. Sound stays independently controlled by **Play sound**, and the **Test** button follows the same toggle. (Thanks @Htwm5, [Issue #25](https://github.com/SlonickLab/Smart-Replay-Mover/issues/25))
- **🖼️ Wallpaper Engine Ignored** — Added `wallpaperui` to the ignore list so Wallpaper Engine's interface isn't mistaken for a game.

### v2.9.4 — 🌍 Multi-Language Folder Names

- **🌍 Any-Language Folders** — Games with Chinese, Japanese, Korean, or Cyrillic names now create correctly-named folders instead of garbled "mojibake" (e.g. `苍蓝彼端`, not `ç»åºé¶æ`). Process detection and folder lookups now use native **Wide (UTF-16) Win32 APIs** (`GetModuleBaseNameW`, `QueryFullProcessImageNameW`, `FindFirstFileW`), so names are lossless regardless of your Windows language. (Surfaced by @YxlaGyb, [PR #24](https://github.com/SlonickLab/Smart-Replay-Mover/pull/24))
- **🧹 Code Health** — Reorganized ~95 globals into namespaced tables (`WIN` / `STATE` / `NOTIF`) to clear LuaJIT's 200-local-per-chunk limit the script had reached (199 → 110), leaving headroom for future features. Purely structural — no behavior change, every `pcall` crash-guard preserved.

### v2.9.3 — 📂 Split Recording Organization Fix

- **📂 Split Recording Fix** — Fixed a critical Lua variable scoping bug where split recordings were not organized into game folders. The `on_recording_file_changed()` signal handler was accessing a global variable instead of the local `current_recording_file`, causing stale paths from previous sessions to persist ([Issue #23](https://github.com/SlonickLab/Smart-Replay-Mover/issues/23))
- **📁 Advanced Output Fallback** — Added fallback for initial recording file path via `obs_output_get_settings()` when `get_last_file` returns empty (common with `adv_file_output`)
- **🛡️ Safety Net** — Signal handler now recovers previous file path from output settings when `current_recording_file` was never initialized

### v2.9.2 — 🔄 Replay Buffer Auto-Restart Reliability Fix

- **🔄 Large File Fix** — Fixed a race condition where the Replay Buffer would stay off after saving very large clips (>1GB). The script now uses an **adaptive delay** scaled to the file size (2s for ~200MB up to 45s for ~4GB), giving OBS enough time to stabilize internally before restarting ([Issue #22](https://github.com/SlonickLab/Smart-Replay-Mover/issues/22))
- **✅ Start Verification** — After restarting, the script now verifies the buffer is actually active and retries up to 3 times if OBS silently ignored the start call
- **🛡️ Safety Timeout** — 5-second safety timeout force-restarts the buffer if the expected stop event never fires
- **📂 Restart Independence** — Auto-restart logic now runs regardless of file path detection

### v2.9.1 — 🔔 Windows 11 Notification Fix & Update Status Reset

- **🔔 Win11 Notification Fix** — Notification popups now properly re-assert TOPMOST Z-order on window reuse, fixing invisible notifications on Windows 11
- **📦 Stale Update Status Fix** — Update status resets to neutral on every OBS launch, preventing users from seeing an outdated "✅ Up to date" indefinitely
- **🐛 Debug Logging** — Added exclusive fullscreen detection state logging for easier diagnostics

### v2.9.0 — 🐧 Linux Support & Cross-Platform Architecture

- **🐧 Linux Support** — Full cross-platform support! Game detection via `xprop` (X11) and `gdbus` (KDE/Wayland), notifications via `notify-send`, audio via `paplay`/`pw-play`. (PR by @zxsleebu, [#19](https://github.com/SlonickLab/Smart-Replay-Mover/issues/19))
- **🖥️ OS Mode Selector** — New dropdown in Tools & Debug: Auto-Detect, Windows, or Linux. Windows-only features auto-hide on Linux.
- **🛡️ Crash Prevention** — Every platform-specific code path wrapped in `pcall()`. Script never crashes regardless of OS mode mismatch.
- **🔧 FFI Consolidation** — All Windows API definitions merged into a single guarded block for maximum stability.
- **🎮 Linux OBS Sources** — Scans `xcomposite_input`, `pipewire-window-capture-source`, `xshm_input` and more.
- **🎵 Linux Audio** — Notification sound playback via `paplay` (PulseAudio) or `pw-play` (PipeWire).
- **🖥️ Adaptive UI** — Windows-only settings (Scan Processes, Scale, Position, Update Checker) auto-hide on Linux.
- **🎬 FFmpeg Thumbnails on Linux** — Proper shell quoting, path validation, and error logging for cross-platform FFmpeg support.

### v2.8.2

- **🔍 Background Game Detection** — Added an option to scan all running processes for a game if the active window isn't one. This serves as a smart fallback if you alt-tabbed to Discord or the desktop before saving a clip! (Feature request: @EndCod3r)
- **🛡️ 100% Anti-Cheat Safe** — The implementation uses zero-overhead, read-only `Toolhelp32Snapshot` APIs, rendering it completely invisible to anti-cheat systems.
- **🐛 Alt-Tab Detection Fix** — Fixed a logic flaw where alt-tabbing to an ignored process (like OBS) would previously bypass OBS Game Capture checks.

### v2.8.1 (Hotfix)

- **🛡️ CRITICAL FIX** — Smart Save Hotkey no longer crashes or freezes OBS ([Discussion #16](https://github.com/SlonickLab/Smart-Replay-Mover/discussions/16))
- **🧵 Thread-Safe Notifications** — All notification calls now go through a safe queue processed exclusively on one thread, eliminating cross-thread Win32 GDI deadlocks
- **⚡ Smart Skip** — On fast systems (NVMe/SSD), the intermediate "Saving..." is automatically skipped in favor of "Clip Saved" when save completes instantly
- **🐛 Detection Fix** — Fixed double `detect_game()` call during replay buffer save that could cause wrong folder assignment
